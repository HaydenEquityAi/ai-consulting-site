## Introduction

System architecture patterns provide proven solutions to common design problems. Understanding these patterns is essential for building robust, scalable systems.

## Common Patterns

### Layered Architecture

Separating concerns into distinct layers improves maintainability and makes systems easier to understand and modify.

### Microservices

Breaking applications into smaller, independent services enables better scalability and allows teams to work independently.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right architecture pattern depends on your specific requirements, team structure, and long-term goals.
