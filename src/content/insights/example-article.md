## Introduction

Building AI systems that scale from prototype to production is one of the most challenging aspects of modern software development. While many teams can create working prototypes, few successfully deploy systems that handle millions of requests while maintaining reliability and performance.

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Microservices Architecture

Breaking down monolithic AI applications into smaller, independent services allows for better scalability and maintainability. Each service can be scaled independently based on demand.

### Pattern 2: Event-Driven Design

Using event-driven architectures enables systems to handle high loads by processing requests asynchronously. This pattern is particularly effective for AI workloads that may have variable processing times.

### Pattern 3: Caching Strategies

Implementing intelligent caching at multiple layers reduces load on AI models and improves response times. Cache invalidation strategies are critical for maintaining accuracy.

## Conclusion

The key to scalable AI systems lies in thoughtful architecture decisions made early in the development process. By following proven patterns and designing for scale from the start, teams can build systems that grow with their business needs.
