      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in energy"
      paragraph1="Energy is a game of velocity. The fastest operators optimize asset performance quicker, respond to grid demands faster, and maximize uptime. But velocity alone isn't enough—you still need safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance."
      paragraph2="Most energy companies face a painful tradeoff: optimize for speed and increase risk, or maintain safety margins and leave money on the table. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you operate at peak efficiency without sacrificing safety or compliance."

Every feature is engineered to eliminate friction, automate drudgery, and create competitive advantage."
