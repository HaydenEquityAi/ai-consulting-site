      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in property management"
      paragraph1="Property management is a scaling game. The fastest firms manage more properties, handle maintenance issues faster, and collect rents on time. But scaling quickly can mean operational chaos—overworked teams, missed maintenance, and tenant complaints that damage your reputation."
      paragraph2="Most property management companies face a painful tradeoff: grow your portfolio and lose operational control, or maintain tight operations and cap your growth. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you scale your portfolio without sacrificing service quality or adding overhead."
