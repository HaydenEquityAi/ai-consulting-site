      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in commercial real estate"
      copy={`Commercial real estate is a game of velocity. The fastest firms source more deals, underwrite faster, and close more transactions. But velocity alone isn't enough—you still need rigor, accuracy, and investor confidence.

Most CRE firms face a painful tradeoff: move fast and risk quality, or maintain rigor and lose deals. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you move at market speed without sacrificing accuracy or operational control.`}
