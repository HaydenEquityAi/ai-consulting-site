      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in construction"
      paragraph1="Construction is a game of velocity. The fastest firms complete projects on schedule, manage budgets tight, and coordinate crews without delays. But velocity alone isn't enough—you still need accuracy, safety, and profitability."
      paragraph2="Most construction companies face a painful tradeoff: accelerate schedules and miss safety, or maintain controls and lose profits to schedule delays. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you move at construction speed without sacrificing safety or margin."
