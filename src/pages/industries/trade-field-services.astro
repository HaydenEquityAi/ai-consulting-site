      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in trade services"
      paragraph1="Trade services is a game of velocity. The fastest companies dispatch crews immediately, complete jobs on schedule, and bill customers faster. But velocity alone isn't enough—you still need quality, safety, and profitability."
      paragraph2="Most trade and field service companies face a painful tradeoff: dispatch fast and lose profitability, or maintain tight controls and lose jobs to competitors. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you move at service speed without sacrificing quality or margin."
