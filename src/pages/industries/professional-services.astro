      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in professional services"
      paragraph1="Professional services is a game of velocity. The fastest firms deliver projects on time, optimize resource utilization, and bill clients faster. But velocity alone isn't enough—you still need quality, accuracy, and profitability."
      paragraph2="Most professional services firms face a painful tradeoff: move fast and sacrifice profitability, or maintain tight controls and lose deals to competitors. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you deliver projects at speed without sacrificing margin or project quality."
