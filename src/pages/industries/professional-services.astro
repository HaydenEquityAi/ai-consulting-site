      headline="Speed is competitive advantage in commercial real estate"
      paragraph1="Commercial real estate is a game of velocity. The fastest firms source more deals, underwrite faster, and close more transactions. But velocity alone isn't enough—you still need rigor, accuracy, and investor confidence."
      paragraph2="Most CRE firms face a painful tradeoff: move fast and risk quality, or maintain rigor and lose deals. Intelio eliminates this choice by building purpose-built systems that let you move at market speed without sacrificing accuracy or operational control."
