          You're probably running on some combination of spreadsheets, disconnected tools, and institutional knowledge living in people's heads.<br><br>
          It feels normal because every business does it. That doesn't make it less destructive.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-8">Here's what actually happens:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <!-- Problem 1 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Fragmented Tools Create Fragmented Reality</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your CRM is the source of truth for sales. Your accounting system is the source of truth for finance. Your project management tool is the source of truth for delivery. Three different versions of the same business. Three different answers to the same question. Teams make decisions based on incomplete information because the complete picture doesn't exist in any single place.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem 2 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Manual Processes Don't Scale</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You can manage data entry and reconciliation with 5 people. You can't do it with 50. Every time you grow, you don't add capability—you add administrative burden. Your team stops building and starts managing spreadsheets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem 3 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Low-Code Tools Hit a Wall</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Retool, Airtable, Zapier—these are excellent for simple problems. But the moment your requirements get sophisticated, you hit the platform's ceiling. You end up paying premium prices for a tool that can't actually do what you need. You're stuck or you start over from scratch.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem 4 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">You Don't Own Your System</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            When your business runs on Airtable, you're renting Airtable's product. When requirements change, you're at the mercy of their roadmap. When you want to integrate a custom capability, you're constrained by their platform. Your competitive advantage doesn't belong to you—it belongs to the vendor.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem 5 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Growth Becomes Friction</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Every new market, customer segment, or product line means rebuilding systems. You're not accelerating. You're compounding complexity. The systems that powered your first $1M can't power your next $10M without complete architectural rethinking.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your data has relationships and complexity that generic tools can't handle. We design relational database systems that capture the nuance of your business logic—deal matrices that score buyers against properties in real-time, project delivery systems that track costs and timelines simultaneously, financial systems that forecast revenue while reconciling actuals.<br><br>
            The result: A single source of truth. Not a workaround. Not a hack. A system designed to handle the real complexity of how you operate.

            Routine work kills productivity. We embed automation into the system itself—workflows triggered by database changes, business events captured and routed automatically, integrations that sync data without manual intervention, intelligence that improves decisions.<br><br>

            We don't use drag-and-drop builders or pre-built templates. We build interfaces from scratch using React, designed specifically for your workflows. Real-time dashboards that show what matters. Forms that guide decisions. Reports that answer the questions leadership actually asks.<br><br>
            Your team doesn't adapt to the software. The software adapts to your team.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How long does a full-stack custom system take to build?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Typical timeline is 8–12 weeks from discovery to go-live. That breaks down roughly as: Discovery & architecture (1–2 weeks), Development (4–6 weeks), Integration & testing (1–2 weeks), Go-live & optimization (2 weeks). The timeline depends on complexity, data volume, integrations, and your team's availability. We keep things moving fast.

        <!-- Q2 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Can you integrate with our existing CRM / accounting / operations tools?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Yes, that's standard. We design systems to integrate with what you already have—Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Stripe, Slack, whatever you use. The goal is to enhance your existing tools, not replace them. If an integration doesn't exist off-the-shelf, we build it. Your system becomes the connecting layer between everything else.

        </div>

        <!-- Q3 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Do we own the system, or are we locked into you?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You own everything. The code. The data. The infrastructure. You can take it somewhere else if you want (though you won't want to). We maintain it and optimize it because it's our job, not because we're holding it hostage. If you want to walk away tomorrow, you can. You won't be able to, but you technically could.

        <!-- Q4 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What if we need changes or new features after launch?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            That's not an extra cost. Weekly iteration cycles are built into the engagement. Need a new dashboard? New automation? New integration? We do it in the weekly cycle. Major additions might scope into the next month, but small improvements and optimizations are continuous.
          </p>

        <!-- Q5 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 border-2 border-gray-200">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How much does a custom system cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Initial build ranges from $15K for straightforward implementations to $50K+ for complex systems with heavy integration. Monthly maintenance and hosting runs $2K–$5K if you operate it, or $3K–$7K if we operate it. What matters is the ROI. Most clients recover the investment in the first 6 months through operational efficiency gains.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Can your system handle our volume / complexity / growth?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Yes. We design for scale from day one. The system that handles 100 records handles 100M records. It's not a question of capability—it's a question of architecture. If you're going to grow to 10x your current size in the next 5 years, we design for that today.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Built in. Compliance automation, audit logs, role-based access control, encryption, backup strategies—these aren't add-ons, they're foundational. If you operate in a regulated industry (healthcare, finance, legal), we know what's required and build it from day one.
